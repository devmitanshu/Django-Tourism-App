This repository contains source code for the Django Application for a Tourism App. This is a project done under the Google Cloud Practitioner Program organized by GDSC India. Our team is from GDSC -SVKM's NMIMS Indore.

Problem Statement - 
Tourism industry is developing day by day in India, with increase in development of cities under the Government of India. Every other person wants to relax with his/her family/friends or alone at a holiday destination. Travel industry became a boom after the COVID-19, as people were waiting to travel outside and feel the beauty of the places like Monuments, Mountains, Beaches, Hill Stations, Temples, etc. 

Proposed Solution - 
We have built a Tourism Application using Django Backend Framework; where one can book a package for his/her holiday destination. We used HTML CSS and JavaScript to create the UI, and used Django as a backend to link the database with the UI and for API.
